# ðŸ“± Android Architecture and Boot Process

## âœ… Android Architecture (Layered Overview)

Android is structured in **5 main layers**, each with specific responsibilities:

### 1. Linux Kernel Layer

- Acts as the **core** of the Android OS.
- Provides low-level system functionalities such as:
  - **Process Management**: Controls running processes.
  - **Memory Management**: Allocates and frees memory.
  - **Device Drivers**: Manages communication with hardware components like camera, audio, sensors, etc.
  - **Security**: Enforces user permissions and process isolation.
  - **Networking**: TCP/IP stack support.
- Android uses a **custom Linux kernel** with enhancements like:
  - **Wakelocks**: Prevents the CPU from sleeping.
  - **Binder IPC**: Facilitates inter-process communication.

### 2. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

- HAL provides standard interfaces for the hardware to communicate with higher levels.
- Enables Android system services and apps to operate without needing to know the specifics of underlying hardware.
- Common HAL modules include:
  - **Camera HAL**
  - **GPS HAL**
  - **Bluetooth HAL**
  - **Sensor HAL**

### 3. Native Libraries and Android Runtime

#### Native Libraries

- Written in C/C++, compiled for specific hardware architectures.
- Examples:
  - **OpenGL ES**: For graphics rendering.
  - **WebKit**: Browser engine.
  - **libc**: Standard C library.
  - **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database engine.

#### Android Runtime (ART)

- Executes Android applications.
- Replaced Dalvik in Android 5.0 and later.
- Features:
  - **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Compiles apps during installation.
  - **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management.
  - **Core Java Libraries**: Base class libraries used by applications.

### 4. Application Framework

- The layer where Java/Kotlin-based Android applications interact with the OS.
- Provides a rich API set for developers.
- Major managers and services include:
  - **Activity Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of applications.
  - **Package Manager**: Handles installation and management of apps.
  - **Window Manager**: Manages windows and their layout.
  - **Notification Manager**: Manages status bar notifications.
  - **Location Manager**: Provides location data.

### 5. Applications Layer

- The topmost layer of Android.
- Includes:
  - **Pre-installed system apps**: Phone, Contacts, Settings.
  - **User-installed apps**: Installed from the Play Store or other sources.
- Each application runs in its own sandbox for security.

## ðŸ§­ Android Boot Process (Step-by-Step)

The Android boot process includes several stages, moving from hardware initialization to starting the Android UI:

### 1. Boot ROM

- First code executed when the device is powered on.
- Embedded in the SoC (System on Chip).
- Initializes basic hardware and looks for the next stage bootloader.

### 2. Bootloader

- Second-stage program responsible for:
  - Initializing RAM.
  - Verifying system integrity (e.g., Verified Boot).
  - Loading the Android kernel and initial RAM disk (initramfs).
  - Providing fastboot/recovery modes.

### 3. Kernel

- Executes as the core operating system.
- Initializes essential hardware drivers.
- Mounts the root file system.
- Starts the **`init`** process (first user-space process).

### 4. init Process

- Reads `init.rc` and other configuration scripts.
- Starts system daemons and services (e.g., `servicemanager`, `logd`).
- Starts the **Zygote** process.

### 5. Zygote

- A special process that preloads common Java classes and resources.
- Listens for commands to launch new app processes by **forking** itself.
- This speeds up application startup significantly.

### 6. System Server

- Spawned by Zygote.
- Initializes core Android services:
  - **Activity Manager Service**
  - **Package Manager Service**
  - **Window Manager Service**
  - **Power Manager Service**

### 7. Launcher and Home Screen

- Once system services are ready, the **Launcher** app is started.
- The user interface becomes interactive.
